In this post, I will show a brief note about adding LaTeX support to your Minimal Mistakes Jekyll.


## Step 1. Set Markdown Engine to Kramdown

In your `_config.yml`, change the engine to kramdown as follows

```yml
# Build settings
markdown: kramdown
```

## Step 2. Copy the original `script.html`

To get Latex support, visit the original Minimal Mistakes repo [here](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). Copy over `minimal-mistakes/_includes/scripts.html` and paste to our `_includes/scripts.html`.

## Step 3. Modify `head.html`

Append the following content to `head.html`.

```html
<!-- Mathjax Support -->
<script type="text/javascript" async
  src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML">
</script>
```

## Step 4. Hellow $$\LaTeX$$


use `$$ ... $$` displaying math equation.

<div>
<strong><em>For inline mode</em></strong>
<div style="margin-left:1em;">
    type your equation in line with other text
</div>
<strong><em>For display mode:</em></strong>
<div style="margin-left:1em;">
    type your equation such that there is a <b>blank line</b> before beginning <code>$$</code> and there is a <b>blank line</b> after ending <code>$$</code>
</div>
</div>
<br>
The example is as following

```
The Einstein equations is as following

$$R_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}\,,$$

where $$R_{\mu\nu}$$ is Ricci curvature, $$R$$ is scalar curvature, $$g_{\mu\nu}$$ is metric, $$G=6.67\times 10^{-11}$$ is the Newtonian constant of gravitation, $$c=2.99\times 10^{8}$$ is the speed of light in vacuum and $$T_{\mu\nu}$$ is the stress–energy tensor.
```
