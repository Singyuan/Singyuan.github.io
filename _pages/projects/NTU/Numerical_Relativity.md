## Introduction

  Choptuik presented a numerical study of spherically symmetric collapse of Einstein scalar field equations.

  The following video is shown how the scalar fields transport. This is weak solution because the incoming scalar field can pass through origin, which cannot collapse the spacetime.

  Hence, we want to know how large of the amplitude of the initial scalar fields will collapse the spacetime, <i>i.e.</i> incoming scalar fields "freeze" at origin.

## Goal
   * Confirms the simulative results of Choptuik and summarizes useful numerical techniques.
   * Summarize the analysis of numerical schemes for solving spherical symmetric Einsteinâ€™s equations.
   * A survey of the well-posed boundary condition will be introduced.

## Material
  * [Slides](./../../../pdf/projects/nr/slides(v3).pdf)


## Conclusions
