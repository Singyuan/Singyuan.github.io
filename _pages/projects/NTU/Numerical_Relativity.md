## Introduction
Choptuik presented a numerical study of spherically symmetric collapse of Einstein scalar field equations. 

## Goal
   * Confirms the simulative results of Choptuik and summarizes useful numerical techniques.
   * Summarize the analysis of numerical schemes for solving spherical symmetric Einsteinâ€™s equations.
   * A survey of the well-posed boundary condition will be introduced.
